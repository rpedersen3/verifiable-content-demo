-- spec 277/278 — cross-principal ENTITLEMENTS (org → member).
--
-- The issuer LEDGER + authority store for AgenticEntitlementCredentialV1s an org issues to a member
-- (a different SA who does NOT custody the org). This table IS the trusted authority the entitlement
-- resolver consults: the @agenticprimitives/entitlements matching engine deliberately checks no
-- signature (credentials are trusted upstream), so a row here = a valid grant. Access to the org's
-- data is gated SOLELY by a matching, granted, unexpired row — never by custody/stewardship.
--
--   principal = the data OWNER (the org SA whose vault is read), lowercased
--   actor     = the GRANTEE (the member SA authorized to read), lowercased
--   resource  = the vault resource the grant covers (e.g. vault:impact-profile)
